        <p>A classic italian recipe with a little bite that goes perfectly with parmesan cheese.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
            <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li> 
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally 
                until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. 
                Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over 
                medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce 
                heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir 
                until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. 
                Pour in olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and 
                half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; stir until combined.</li>
            <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
